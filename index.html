    Hi! My name is Iris Bae.<br>
    I'm an aspiring developer that self-taught HTML/CSS/Unity/C#/Python.<br>
    I have the tendancy to lock in on a project, spending sleepless nights.<br>
    Thanks to this, I learn skills fast and thoroughly.<br>
    I'm currently learning C++ and want to learn more.<br>
    I love learning new things regardless of what field it's in.<br>

    <p>I am someone who firmly believes that anything is possible. <br>
       Throughout my gap year, I started and continued various pursuits. <br>
       These are some activities that I'm still doing to this day.

     September 1st. 2018<br>
       The date I first won an award through my work and the date I fell in love with painting.
     Visualising something that was only in my head granted me a whole new feeling of achievement.
    <br>  Although my passion for creating, I slowly had to prioritize studying and just recently(2024.Jan~) grabbed my pen to start learning all over again.
     If the little me enjoyed drawing from scratch, I now learned to love urban sketching.
     <br>  I established an instagram account for my art and implemented my skills to pottery as well.

<h4>-Guitar</h4>
   <img src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="image of my guitar" style="width:420px; height:220px;">
<p>
    I bought this classic guitar to practice songs for my music class back in 2023.<br>
    The catch was-I was supposed to buy an acoustic guitar but messed up, buying the wrong one.
   <br> To this day, I'm teaching myself to play a song, learning a couple of lines each day.<br>
    You can listen to my performance here!â¬‡

<h4>-Running</h4>

<p>
    I own three medals.
    The first one is from a 3km marathon, participated in 7th grade.<br>
    The other two are from last year, both 10kms.
    Despite not earning any gold medals, I'm glad to take a foot into running, as the goal is to finish, not win.<br>
    I still work out several days a week, and am hoping to run another marathon one day.

        This is a game submitted to the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024">2024 GMTK Game Jam</a> called 'Shadow'.<br>
        I worked as the leader of a team of four. Juggling various tasks-pixel art, building levels, coding, uploading-we were able to make this game to life within 72 hours.<br>
        I am still implementing certain features to the game, since it means more than just a video game to me.<br>

      <br><br>
    <p>
        This is a multiplayer game I am currently working on.<br>
        After submitting "Shadow", I brainstormed the idea for this relaxing multiplayer game.<br>
        The objective is to help neighbors around you, solving riddles and often fighting to protect them.<br>
        The multiplayer feature is already executed but the development of the game is delayed since I'm taking time to learn game storytelling and C#.<br>
